A RFO installer and editor* for the macOS ecosystem.

Installer made by 54thTaco, JSON is provided by developer Kaiddd

# Prerequisites 
1. Roblox must be installed
2. A WiFi connection

# Installation
Prior to installing RFO, we need the installer. In that case, use this command:
```
cd ~/Desktop && curl -o RFO-v2P1.zsh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/54thTaco/RFO-macOS/main/RFO-v2P1.zsh && zsh RFO-v2P1.zsh
```
This command goes to your desktop, downloads the program, and runs it. 

Now that you have the installer, press `N` for installation, and you're done!

# Verification
[**OPTIONAL**]

You can easily check the installation of RFO by pressing `C` with the program opened.

# Renewing
## Without the Installer

Redo the command listed in [**Installation**](https://github.com/54thTaco/RFO-macOS#installation).

## With Installer

Use this command to reopen the installer:
```
zsh [Path to installer]
```
To get your installer's path, simply place your installer into your terminal window.

If you did it correctly, you should have something like this:
```
zsh /Users/taco/Desktop/RFO-v2P1.zsh/
```
