# Installation
Prior to installing RFO, we need the installer. In that case, use this command:
```
cd ~/Desktop && curl -o RFO-v2P1.zsh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/54thTaco/RFO-macOS/main/RFO-v2P2.zsh && zsh RFO-v2P2.zsh
```
This command goes to your desktop, downloads the program, and runs it. 

Now that you have the installer, press `N` for installation, and you're done!

# Verification
